# easy21_MonteCarlo_Sarsa
## Computational Intelligence (REI101M fall 2018)
## University of Iceland

Code for Computational Assignment 1 in the course Reiknigreind at University of Iceland. The goal of this assignment is to apply reinforcement learning methods to a
simple card game that we call Easy21. The methods implemented are Monte Carlo Control and Sarsa(λ).

## Prerequisites
Python 3  
numpy  
matplotlib

## Running the code
All of the code is self sustained in a single file [easy21.py](easy21.py) and it can be ran as is:
```
python easy21.py
```
Example of the code and what it does is given in the jupyter notebook [easy21.ipynb](easy21.ipynb) where easy21.py is used as an import
